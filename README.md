# EntApp
An application to track entertainment content that has been consumed by the user/they would like to in the future.
It'll track Film, TV, Games, Books & Live Events with some standard fields (title, genre, rating etc).

## TODO:
[x] Review existing code, remove Client/Server mechanism
[] Backend that writes to SQLite DB for Books
[] Repeat for Film/TV, Games & Live Events
[] Backend that reads from SQLite DB for Books
[] Repeat for other mediums
[] API that interfaces with backend
[] Custom search values
[] GUI
[] Add new entries - if already present, update
[] Allow DB to be stored in Google Drive? - Sync across devices?
[] Bulk import via CSV
[] Mobile App
[] Ability to add additional tables?
